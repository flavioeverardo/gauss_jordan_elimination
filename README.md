# gauss_jordan_elimination
Binary Gauss-Jordan Elimination to solve a system of XOR equations. </br>
A set of tests were made including square matrixes, more columns (variables) than rows (equations) and more rows (equations) than columns (variables). </br>
Each test uses two parameters, the initial matrix and a boolean flag. This flag if True, prints the Gauss-Jordan Elimination procedure.
